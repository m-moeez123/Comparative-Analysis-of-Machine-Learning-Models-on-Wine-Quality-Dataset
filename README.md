# Comparative-Analysis-of-Machine-Learning-Models-on-Wine-Quality-Dataset
# Wine Quality Machine Learning Pipeline

This project builds a complete regression and classification pipeline using the **Wine Quality** dataset. We train various models, evaluate performance, and tune hyperparameters.

## ðŸš€ Project Tasks

1. **Data Preprocessing**: missing values, scaling
2. **Feature Engineering**: polynomial features
3. **Model Training**:
   - Linear Regression (Normal Equation)
   - Ridge & Lasso Regression
   - SGD Regressor
   - Logistic Regression
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Regression: RMSE, RÂ²
   - Classification: Accuracy, F1-score
   - Learning curves
5. **Model Comparison Table**
6. **Early Stopping for Logistic Regression (Softmax)**

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- Source: [UCI Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality)
- Target:
  - `quality`: regression
  - `quality_class`: binary classification (`>=7` is good)
